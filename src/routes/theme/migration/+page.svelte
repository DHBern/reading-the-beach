	<p>
		The beach has long been associated with movement and travel. We were particularly interested in
		the different effects of voluntary (such as tourism) and involuntary (such as exile). Our
		original hypothesis was that migration and exile would feature prominently both earlier in the
		century, in literature written during WWII, and towards the end of the long twentieth century.
		However, in our corpus, migration and exile only begin to appear as relevant themes in the
		1990s, with an (expected) peak related to the Mediterranean refugee crisis in contemporary texts
		written since 2010. Additionally, migration and exile play a role in the passage from water to
		land and vice-versa in merfolk literature. Often, aquatic and terrestrial environments are
		juxtaposed as opposite worlds, and the characters’ transition is usually final. The beach
		functions as an important threshold in these instances, since any crossing of the line between
		land and water is always both an arrival and a departure. A physical transformation frequently
		emphasises the potential painfulness of such an adaptation to a new environment.
