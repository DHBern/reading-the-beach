	concept coined by Paul Gilroy. Following Gilroy, the Black Atlantic has to be thought from a
	transnational and intercultural perspective due to its colonial legacy and the transatlantic
	slave trade. While this history is omnipresent in our chosen texts, it was surprising to find
	that the expected themes of migration and death feature only rarely. Instead, we find a
	continuity of leisure as the main theme, with swimming as the most prominent activity. In line
	with the other regions, contemplativeness is a prevalent mood on the literary beaches of the
	Black Atlantic, but it is the juxtaposition of melancholy and playfulness as well as happiness
	which stands out most.</p>`

	<p>
		The beach has long been associated with movement and travel. We were particularly interested in
		the different effects of voluntary (such as tourism) and involuntary (such as exile). Our
		original hypothesis was that migration and exile would feature prominently both earlier in the
		century, in literature written during WWII, and towards the end of the long twentieth century.
		However, in our corpus, migration and exile only begin to appear as relevant themes in the
		1990s, with an (expected) peak related to the Mediterranean refugee crisis in contemporary texts
		written since 2010. Additionally, migration and exile play a role in the passage from water to
		land and vice-versa in merfolk literature. Often, aquatic and terrestrial environments are
		juxtaposed as opposite worlds, and the charactersâ€™ transition is usually final. The beach
		functions as an important threshold in these instances, since any crossing of the line between
		land and water is always both an arrival and a departure. A physical transformation frequently
		emphasises the potential painfulness of such an adaptation to a new environment.
